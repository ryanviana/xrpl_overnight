On this page, the smart contracts and their respective key functions for the system's operation will be documented. The following project involves not only the on-chain credit platform but also the tokenization of the Real and TFPt (Tokenized National Treasury Bonds) securities.

### 1) Tokenized Real (RealTokenizado.sol)
Contract address on XRP EVM sidechain: 0x8fFC3F0E33Fb2fa35619Aa4Eba0fe55382e8C52b

A smart contract developed in the ERC-20 standard to simulate the Tokenized Real. In addition to the essential ERC-20 functions, the following features were also developed:

**1.1) privilegedAccounts:** permissioning so that only the addresses of financial institutions, the Central Bank, and government services have access to these functions. Thus, it is up to the Central Bank to call the addPrivilegedAccount function to allow a new financial institution to operate with the Tokenized Real.

**1.2) privilegedTransfer:** a function developed for banks to have access to transfer Tokenized Real tokens from clients' and users' wallets.

**1.3) functions mintUser and burnUser:** a function developed for financial institutions and the Central Bank to have access to mint and burn tokens of their clients. For example, a user has R$1000 in Tokenized Real and wishes to withdraw this money in physical currency at the bank branch. The bank can then burn these tokens and make the payment in person to the customer.

### 2) Tokenized Public Federal Treasury (TFPt.sol)
Contract address on XRP EVM: 0x84bAf7af378Ba73279fD92474e181324Fba31Ac7

A smart contract for the tokenization of National Treasury bonds. Also developed with the ERC-20 standard, this contract presents greater complexity, and below are the main features:

**2.1) Privileged Accounts:** all the logic already explained previously.

**2.2) Variables and Constructor:** the deployment of this contract should be carried out to issue a tokenized National Treasury bond. When deploying, it is necessary to pass in the constructor some relevant variables such as the name of the bond, symbol, maximum amount of tokens to be issued, initial unit price, maturity date, minimum investment, type of asset, and the address of the Tokenized Real. In this contract, we are considering the tokenization of a Tesouro Selic bond, which yields according to the variation of the Selic rate.

**2.3) function getTokenPrice:** a function responsible for calculating the asset's current price. For this, the interestRate, a variable that stores the profitability of the asset in question, is used.

**2.4) function invest:** a function that the bank/financial institution must call to make an on-chain investment in this bond by one of its clients. The function will receive the individual's contribution amount, check if it is higher than the minimum investment, receive the Tokenized Real from the user's wallet corresponding to the investment, send the TPFt tokens based on the asset price at the time, and list the investor in the list of investors for that asset. If the investor is already listed, they will not be added again.

**2.5) function withdrawInvestor:** a function used for the financial institution to liquidate an investor's bonds. In this function, the opposite mechanism of invest is performed: the smart contract receives the number of TPFt tokens from the user's wallet and pays the investor with the Tokenized Real based on the asset's current price.

**2.6) function withdrawBacen:** a function used for the Central Bank to receive the Tokenized Real tokens from all investments made in that bond.

### 3) Overnight (Overnight.sol)
Contract address on XRP EVM sidechain: 0xF6ab2D1f34031B564562c012F5809e3F7F28661B

Overnight is the smart contract implementation of our collateralized credit mechanism with Tokenized Real. This contract not only serves for banks to obtain collateralized credit for overnight operations but also for liquidity providers to be paid the next day with the profitability of the 24-hour Selic Over rate; otherwise, the creditor has the right to redeem the operation's collateral.

**3.1) struct liquidityRequest:** a Solidity struct that stores a series of relevant data from each liquidity request, such as the institution, wallet, total amount, raised amount, collateral asset, collateral smart contract, date, and a list with the liquidity providers and how much each provided.

**3.2) Privileged accounts:** all the permissioning logic already explained previously.

**3.3) function setInterestRateDaily:** a function to determine the daily interest rate to be used in operations when paying creditors. In Brazil, the Selic Over rate is used.

**3.4) function createLiquidityRequest:** a function to be called to create a liquidity request and lock the collateral assets in the smart contract.

**3.5) function provideLiquidity:** a function used to provide liquidity, that is, to send money (BRL) to those requesting liquidity and store it in smart contracts. This is registered in the smart contract to later perform payment operations.

**3.6) function payCreditors:** a function with the implementation to calculate the amount that should be paid to each liquidity provider and pay them automatically with interest. In addition, this marks the end of that operation, leaving it with a Closed status.

**3.7) function defaultPayment:** a function that should be called by liquidity providers to redeem the guarantee related to that operation in case of default (+ 24 hours).

### 4) Math (math.sol)
Smart contract from the DSMath library for mathematical calculations in Solidity.
